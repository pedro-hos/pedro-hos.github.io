          This is a web scraping project that I created to "get" secret budgets from Brazil that was not easily visible. So I got this information from the transparency portal and also collected the receiver's budget information through their documents. All information is avaible on a Postgres database dump. 
          
          Technologies used: <mark>Java</mark>, <mark>Quarkus</mark>, <mark>Apache Camel</mark>, <mark>JSoup</mark> and <mark>Postgres</mark>.

            Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.
